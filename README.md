# Social-Network-Startup-API
![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
With the goal of creating a startup social network, I have created an API using a NoSQL database so that my website can handle large amounts of unstructured data. By entering the command to invoke the application my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the database. When I open API GET routes in Insomnia, I can return all user and thoughts or single users and thoughts by a selected ID. When I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia I can successfully create, update, and delete data in my database.
